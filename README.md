    Every ITSY Episode 3D models and animations are embedded in Prefabs.
    In the current implementation, a simple touch from the user spawns the chosen episode Prefab.

    You are able to export it for AR in either Android or iOS devices.

    4. Include "Scenes/ITSY" in "Scenes to Build".
    5. Change your desired platform to Android or iOS.
